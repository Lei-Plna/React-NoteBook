## button-status
&emsp;This folder will record the basic usage of React. We will only use ReactDOM.createRoot(), React.createElement and React.Component to create a simple React application about a button and a tag "p" to show the status of the button. The button will have two status: "Open" and "Closed". When the button is clicked, the status will change. The tag "p" will show the status of the button.
