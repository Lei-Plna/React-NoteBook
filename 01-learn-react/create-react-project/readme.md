# Introduction
Before we create our first React project, we need to install Node.js.

We need nodejs version 8.10 or higher.

We will use the command that "npx create-react-app my-app" to create our first React project.

The Npx is a tool below npm 5.2 version. It can help us to execute the command that we installed in the local node_modules folder.

create-react-app internal use the babel, webpack to build the project same with Vue, but we can't configure the option like Vue.

Such as we can choose the vue version、vue-router、vuex、eslint、babel、webpack and so on in Vue project.

But we can't configure it now and future in React project.

Because the React is not a framework, it is a library. It'll not provide the configuration for us.

# What we do first
After we create the React project we can remove some files that we needn't such as index.css, App.css, React.logo and so on. And then we need modify relational files which use we removed.

So far we get the template for React basic project.
